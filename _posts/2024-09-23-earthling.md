We are studying the human grasp of meaning for life in a dopamine deprived world.
In all classes and corners of the earth, humans have access to each other through the internet like
we've never seen before. Due to our connectivity and limitless access to knowledge and constant 
stimulation in the form of a phone screen, TV or a computer desktop, our longing for experiences 
have broadened deeply. As they say, "A mile wide and an inch deep." I want to know how individuals 
access the deepest truth of themselves, unabashed by the digital world. Who are we truly? What 
are our created reasons to live virtuous lives?
